Loop and Delay: We have introduced a for loop to specify the number of packets to send (num_packets). With each iteration, a new packet is crafted and unleashed upon the target. Additionally, we have added a delay parameter to introduce a pause between each packet, measured in seconds. Adjust these values to control the intensity and longevity of your deception.

Customization: The target_ip, target_port, spoofed_url, and spoofed_host variables can be customized to suit your specific target and spoofing preferences. Replace them with the appropriate values to create a more tailored and convincing attack.

sendp() Function: We continue to utilize the sendp() function to send the crafted packet at the data-link layer. This enables us to inject our deceptive frames directly into the network, ensuring a higher level of realism and effectiveness.
